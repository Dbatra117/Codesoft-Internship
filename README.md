# Codesoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my **Codesoft Internship Repository**!  
This repository contains three beginner-friendly C++ projects that demonstrate problem-solving, logical thinking, and programming fundamentals.

## Projects Overview

# Task 1: Simple Calculator:
- Menu-driven interface for smooth user experience  
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Looping prompt to perform multiple operations  
- Option to exit anytime

## How It Works

1. The program displays a menu with four arithmetic operations.
2. The user selects an operation by entering a number between 1 and 4.
3. The program prompts for two numbers and performs the selected operation.
4. The result is displayed instantly.
5. The user is asked whether they want to perform another operation.
6. If the user enters `'y'`, the menu is shown again. If `'n'`, the program exits gracefully.

#  Task 2: Number Guessing Game

It is a console-based **Number Guessing Game** written in C++.  
The program generates a random number, and the user has to guess it with hints until the correct number is found.

---

## Features
- Random number generation  
- User guesses with input prompts  
- Hints if the guess is too high or too low  
- Success message when the correct number is guessed  
- Loop continues until the user wins  

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works
1. The program generates a random number within a fixed range (e.g., 1–100).  
2. The user enters a guess.  
3. If the guess is higher than the target, the program shows *“Too high!”*.  
4. If the guess is lower than the target, the program shows *“Too low!”*.  
5. If the guess matches the target, the program congratulates the user and ends.

#  Task 3: To-Do List Manager

This is Task 3. It is a console-based **To-Do List Manager** written in C++.  
The program allows users to add, view, mark, and remove tasks with a simple menu-driven interface.

---

## Features
- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks with status (Pending/Completed)  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Remove tasks from the list  
- Menu-driven loop until the user exits  

---

## How It Works
1. The program displays a menu with options to manage tasks.  
2. The user selects an option (Add, View, Mark Completed, Remove, Exit).  
3. Tasks are stored in a list (`vector<Task>`).  
4. Each task has a description and a status (Pending/Completed).  
5. The user can continue managing tasks until they choose to exit.
